1. Why do map have to return else it will not show anything 
Well we can use implicit return there too, why do we use the implictand explicit return and how?
2. 
const Port=process.env.PORT || 5100;  where does the that PORT comes from that env file, well it wasn't imported it there 
3. Check for the Backend learning text file , least that GPT Chat, well there is definetly the learning file 
4. Check about the Education Schema and UI in place of courses
5.if (e.key === "Enter") {
  setSkill((prev) => {
    const newSkills = [...prev, e.target.value];
    console.log("Next Skills:", newSkills);
    return newSkills;
  });
}
Here you’re logging inside the updater function — so it captures the next array right before returning it.
(What is updater function)
6. i have heard that it gives error if we have anything in a first callback
  useEffect(()=>{
      console.log("Skills: ",skill)
  },[skill])

  7. ---- let's discuss about something we wanted to create the Componenet Which will have Title and one Horizontal Line 

- My logic was like something like this 
    // <div className="flex justify-start">
    //   <h2 className="text-white text-4xl mr-[40px]">{title}</h2>
    //   <div className="flex  items-center">
    //     <div className="bg-tertiory h-[2px] w-[300px] inline-block"></div>
    //   </div>
    // </div>

  So i thought we set the outter to the start with flex , now our Title is in Place, but to place the line , what we will do is that, i created the wrapper for line , set it to the flex and items-center to set it into the middle, 
  Also inline-block was for span to set the height and width 

  - Approch from GPT
      <div className="flex items-center w-full">
      <h2 className="text-white text-4xl mr-[40px] whitespace-nowrap">
        {title}
      </h2>
      <div className="bg-tertiory h-[2px] flex-grow w-[300px]"></div>
    </div>
  Here simply what GPT did is that,just set the outter div to flex and set the items-center that and there, that's all, Also Actually we don't need the w-full, but it result in the long horizontal line, flex-grow help in that , as we have w-full, flex-grow will give the remaning space to that line, Also whitespace-nowrap is making sure that h2 don't go to next line 

8. Wrirte about fixed and sticky we use with headr and socioalShare Compenenet
9. i don't rweally understand in my projcet when i make some chnages it does not load the whole page , like does not refresh , just add what i ahve newly added  , but in our company page it happens , raload on each chnage why is that 


10. Let's check about the try catch with this example, why it did not crash the 
  const handleAPICall=async(Data)=>{
    // try {
      const res= await axios.put(`${BASE_URL}UpdateAboutMe1`,Data);
      console.log("res: ",res)
      toast.success(res.data.MSG)
    // } catch (error) {
    //   console.log("There is been Error: ",error);
    //   toast.error("Error Occured Updating About")

    // }

  UpdateAboutMe1 wrong route, let's understand it 
  also Would you like me to also explain how try-catch differs from Promise .catch() and when each is better (e.g., try-catch vs .then().catch() in axios)?
